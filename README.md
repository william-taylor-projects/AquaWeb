This is just a concept for a little KDB+ querying tool. Not currently going anywhere, and it's only a mock for the UI layer but something might come from it eventually. I built it in Angular so if I expand on it in the future I have a good base to start from. But yeah that is basically it, will be interesting to see if the idea lifts off...
